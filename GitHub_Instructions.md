# Creating and deleting branches within your repository

You can create or delete branches directly on GitHub.

## Creating a branch

- Currently, there is one branch as shown below:

- On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.

- Click the branch selector menu.

and 'Enter'.

Now, the branch is created and see the number of branches has now changed to '2'.

As shown in above image, we are in 'Child_Branch' and not the master. Whatever, is in the master file is copied to the child branch. But when we add a file or edit any file in child branch that will not reflect in the 'Master' branch.

## Adding a file in the Child Branch

- Click 'Add file' and select 'Create New file' to create a file in the repository.

- Provide the file name and the extension of the file. For example, testchild.py and add the lines.

- Scroll down the page after adding the text. Add description of the file (optional) and click 'Commit new file'.
