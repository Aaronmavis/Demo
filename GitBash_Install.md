## Introduction

## GitBash 

Git Bash for Windows is a package that includes git and bash.

Git is an open-source version control system for tracking source code changes when developing software. It keeps a commit history which allows you to revert to a stable state in case you mess up your code. Git also allows multiple developers to collaborate on the same code base.

Bash is a Unix command-line shell. The name is an acronym for the ‘Bourne-Again Shell’. It comes with useful Unix commands like cat, ssh, SCP, etc., which are not usually found on Windows.
